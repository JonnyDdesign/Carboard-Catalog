# Cardboard-Catalog

## About the Project
Carboard Catalog is an application used for organizing trading cards.  

The primary functionality will allow users to serach, lookup, and store cards into their personal collection or vault.  

I have a passion for collecting trading cards and always wanted a place to lookup and store cards for easy viewing and sorting into my personal collection. I created this site with the intention to help users lookup and store cards into their collection and easily manage their collection.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js/Express, and SQL

## Setup/Installation
To view the live site, please visit https://www.cardboardcatalog.com

## Status
The site is still under construction and not fully functional at this time. However, please check back as I continue to make updates and work towards completing this project.
